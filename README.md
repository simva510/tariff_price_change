Which Goods Get Pricier? A Data-Driven Look at Tariff Effects on U.S. Consumer Prices

With new trade policies rolling out so rapidly, we’re curious how they’ll affect our daily lives. In 2024 and early 2025, the U.S. announced new rounds of tariffs on Chinese imports under Section 301. These included proposed tariff increases on electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals, and solar equipment. During the most recent US — China “tariff war” in March, some rates have been pushed as high as 145%. After negotiations in May, both countries agreed to reduce these tariffs temporarily for a 90-day public comment and review period, most chinese products are now subject to additional 30% tariff in US. 
While it is challenging to predict exact impact of tariffs on specific goods, we are trying to focus on estimating how these tariff changes could influence costumer’s prices — on a handful selected consumer categories. We analyze these products by combining U.S. import data from the USITC—such as customs value, quantities, and HTS codes—with Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We identify high-impact products by examining tariff exposure and historical CPI changes. The project also incorporates strategic factors like whether a good is essential, how easily it could be replaced by imports from other countries (e.g., Vietnam, Mexico, India), and how sensitive it is to global supply chain risks.
Using machine learning models, we aim to predict which goods are likely to experience noticeable retail price increases and which ones might remain more stable. The goal is to provide a data-driven view of how tariff policy could influence consumer costs across key product categories.
